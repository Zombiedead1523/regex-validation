This program allows you to validate text strings using a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) derived from a regular expression. First, you input the regular expression to construct the corresponding DFA. Then, you can input various strings to check if they match the patterns defined by the regular expression. Itâ€™s a helpful tool for validating and experimenting with regular expressions and automata.
